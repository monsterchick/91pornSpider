# How to use:
```
python3 run main.py
```

# Progress
this project has been roughly done. At least the purpose of downloading videos has been achieved.

# Things need to be improved:
- structure and logic of code(it needs to be more readable)
- adds multiprocessing when downloading videos
- uses Python package to manage different models
- could add a visualizable downloading progress(to increase user experience)
